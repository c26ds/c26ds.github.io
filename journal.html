<h1>Journal Entry 1</h1>
<p> Though this coding process I have learned a lot about how computers function and the difference between what is going on beind the scenes verus the interface I use. Through the terminal going in and out of files was an interesting expierence. Understand that double clicking on a file is just writing the code cd ./file name is crazy. I have also learned about html and that it is a tag based language, meaning that you have tags that set up a form for how the following code has to be written. Also in the video, I leaned a lot about how to edit text for example I can <em>emphasize</em> words. The coding process so far has been a little challenging but very rewarding when it goes right.</p>
