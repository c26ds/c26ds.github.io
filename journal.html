<p class="text"> Though this coding process I have learned a lot about how computers function and the difference between what is going on beind the scenes verus the interface I use. Through the terminal going in and out of files was an interesting expierence. Understand that double clicking on a file is just writing the code cd ./file name is crazy. I have also learned about html and that it is a tag based language, meaning that you have tags that set up a form for how the following code has to be written. Also in the video, I leaned a lot about how to edit text for example I can <em>emphasize</em> words. The coding process so far has been a little challenging but very rewarding when it goes right.</p>

<p class="text">This week I learned about making a menu bar. This included the use of buttons and links. I learned that you can classify divs. By classifying them they can act as something like a button. In addition you can use < a href > to link something. This allowed me to link my journal to my menu bar. Also I wan't to learn about positioning divs on the page. </p>

<p class="text">I learned about JavaScript animations. This allows you to make something that repeats. I made an animation of a team mate scoring a touchdown. It repeats infinitly. I plan to add other players into the animation so it looks more realistic. We used the code keyframes to do this. We did this in the style section by changing the language to javascript and making keyframes. Keyframes are points in the animation and guides movement. I found it challenging</p>
