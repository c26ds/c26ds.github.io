<p class="text"> Though this coding process I have learned a lot about how computers function and the difference between what is going on beind the scenes verus the interface I use. Through the terminal going in and out of files was an interesting expierence. Understand that double clicking on a file is just writing the code cd ./file name is crazy. I have also learned about html and that it is a tag based language, meaning that you have tags that set up a form for how the following code has to be written. Also in the video, I leaned a lot about how to edit text for example I can <em>emphasize</em> words. The coding process so far has been a little challenging but very rewarding when it goes right.</p>

<p class="text">This week I learned about making a menu bar. This included the use of buttons and links. I learned that you can classify divs. By classifying them they can act as something like a button. In addition you can use < a href > to link something. This allowed me to link my journal to my menu bar. Also I wan't to learn about positioning divs on the page. </p>

<p class="text">I learned about JavaScript animations. This allows you to make something that repeats. I made an animation of a team mate scoring a touchdown. It repeats infinitly. I plan to add other players into the animation so it looks more realistic. We used the code keyframes to do this. We did this in the style section by changing the language to javascript and making keyframes. Keyframes are points in the animation and guides movement. I found it challenging</p>

<p class="text"> We made an image follow our mouse. This is part of learning about javascript. To do this we used an event listener. The listener acts upon a mouse move. This could be replaced with a click or key pressed. These functions are something that are already created in a library. To have the image follow the mouse we used the mouses x and y positions. We set the left of the image to the x cooradinate of the mouse and the top of the image to the y coordanite of the mouse. This allows the input to always be changing and keep the image moving. We used div to be this image. I styled my div in Css to have it have certain qualities. Not be too big or small and choose the image.</p>

<p class="text"> The next thing in Javascript we have worked on is if statements. In practical use we used the if statment to have something happen on an input and when the next input occurs another thing will happen. To do this we have to know how many times the mouse has been clicked (event we are making our input). To do this we used the console log function. To count the number of clicks that have occured we used a variable. The variable starts at 0. Everytime the function is run (mouse click) we reset the variable to the current value plus one. To document this we used the console log to record the variable value. To determine what our if statments act on we need to determine whether the amount of mouse click is odd or even. We need to do this so it can turn on on the first click and turn off on the next click. We want a sound (could be any thing) to play when the mouse was clicked and wanted it to stop when we clicked again. To determine if the amount of clicks was odd or even we divided the variable value by 2. If the remainder is 1, the sound played. if the remainder is 0, the sound paused. These was achieved using two if statments. </p>
