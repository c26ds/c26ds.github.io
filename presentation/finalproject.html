				<section><p>This is my final project</p></section>
				<section><p>In class we were tasked with using a library called Reveal.js to make slide shows.</p></section>
				<section><p>Originally I didn't have a topic that appealed to me. As a result, I just started playing around with the code that the base slides had.</p></section>
				<section><p>I ended up just making more and more slides. I ended up with this </p></section>
				<section><a href="index3.html"><center><div id="link" style="opacity: 1.0; width: 400px; height: 200px;">First slides</div></center></a></section>
				<section>As you can see there is not that much going on and at this point it was not presentable to the class - We had to present in two days.</section>
				<section>In reveal.js to go forward on the slides you only have to click a button. Which made my first slides pretty useless because you could hold down an arrow key and get through all of the slides very quickly</section>
				<section>I decided to make a small puzzle on every slide and the reslut will be a number. You use that number at the end to unlock more slides.</section>
				<!-- <section>I decided to make it a puzzle to eventually unlock this lock to reveal a codesketch</section> -->

				<!-- <section><a href="finallock.html"><center><div id="link" style="opacity: 1.0; width: 400px; height: 200px;">Second slides</div></center></a></section> -->
				<section><a href="index.html"><center><div id="link" style="opacity: 1.0; width: 400px; height: 200px;">Second slides</div></center></a></section>
				<section>The most difficult thing was making the lock at the end</section>
				<section data-background-size="contain" data-background-image="code.png"></section>
				<!-- <section>This code for the lock is also used to unlock the final puzzle.</section> -->
				<!-- <section><a href="index4.html"><center><div id="link" style="opacity: 1.0; width: 400px; height: 200px;">Second slides</div></center></a></section> -->
